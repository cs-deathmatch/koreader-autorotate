# koreader-autorotate
A simple plugin for Koreader to automatically rotate the page to landscape if it's a double page (only tested with CBZ files)

To install it simply copy the plugins folder to your plugin folder in your reader.

### I didn't like the direction it rotated, so i [forked](https://github.com/Extraltodeus/koreader-autorotate) it and swapped the directions. One line change, just figured I'd upload this in case it helps anybody else
